************************ Object and its internal representation *********************************


   A JS object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).

   Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

   example,

         var car = "Audi";

         var car = { Make: "Audi", Model: "C-Class", Color: "White"};

    The values are written as Key:value pairs are called properties

    JS objects are containers for named values

    The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.

    Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted.

    An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
