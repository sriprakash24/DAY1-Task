	HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

	HTTP1 used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles. HTTP2 will use binary commands to execute the same tasks.

	HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol so that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster

    HTTP/1.1 has a different technique called resource inlining, wherein the server includes the required source within the HTML page in response to the initial GET request.
    So this technique reduces the number of requests that the client must send, the larger, non-text format files increase the size of the page.
    As a result, the connection speed decreases, and the primary benefit obtained from it also nullifies.
    Another drawback is the client cannot separate the inlined resources from the HTML page.
    
    HTTP/2 supports multiple simultaneous responses to the clientâ€™s initial GET request, the server provides the required resource along with the requested HTML page. 
    This is called the server push process, this process fixes the main drawback of resource inlining by enabling the client machine to decide to cache/decline the pushed resource separate from the HTML page.

    
    HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1
